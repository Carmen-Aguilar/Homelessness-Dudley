In December 2017 I reported that Dudley has the lowest homelessness rate in England, according to the figures from the second quarterly of the year of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

# Get the data
The data was downloaded from the website of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government">Department for Communities and Local Government</a> (DCLG).

The last figures published by this institution corresponded to the months April – September 2017. I also used the DCLG annual data, obtained in the same website and by the same method. 

The files below show the information used for this report.

# Visualisation
Charts were created in codepen.io using the code from CanvasJS and added afterward to the website in Atom.

Using Tableau, I created the chart “Priority need vs. not priority need” in the Black Country.
